## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Database Schema Updates

#### Updated Prisma Schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)

```prisma
model Lead {
  id         Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name       String    @map("lead_name")
  email      String    @default("")
  phone      String    @map("lead_phone")
  message    String?
  propertyId Int?      @map("property_id")
  brokerId   Int?      @map("broker_id") // ✅ NEW: Broker who listed the property
  companyId  Int?      @map("company_id")
  status     String    @default("new") // ✅ new, contacted, negotiating, closed
  createdAt  DateTime  @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt  DateTime  @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  // Relations
  property Property? @relation(fields: [propertyId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  broker   User?     @relation("BrokerLeads", fields: [brokerId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  company  Company?  @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
