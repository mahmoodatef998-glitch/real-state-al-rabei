## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Property must have a valid broker"

**Cause:** Property doesn't have an owner or owner is not a broker/admin

**Solution:**
1. Check property in database
2. Ensure `owner_id` is set
3. Ensure owner has role "broker" or "admin"

```sql
-- Check property owner
SELECT p.id, p.title, u.id as owner_id, u.name, u.role 
FROM properties p 
LEFT JOIN users u ON p.owner_id = u.id 
WHERE p.id = <property_id>;
```

### Issue 2: Notification Count Not Updating

**Cause:** React Query cache not refreshing

**Solution:**
- Wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh
- Manually refresh page
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue 3: Can't See Any Leads

**Cause:** Logged in as broker with no leads

**Solution:**
1. Create a lead for one of your properties
2. Or login as admin to see all leads
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM leads WHERE broker_id = <your_id>;`

### Issue 4: Modal Not Opening

**Cause:** JavaScript error or missing import

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console
2. Ensure all dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Restart frontend dev server
